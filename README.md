# Wise Agents: A Distributed AI Multi-Agent Framework

Wise-agent is a framework implementing an architecture of distributed multi-AI agents.

## Multi-agent system
Agents can be considered composable and adaptable AI components which have memory,  and are able to receive an input request, collect external information, take actions and collaborate with other agents or humans to get the outcomes requested.

Gartnerâ€™s definition of a multi-agent system is: 
>A multiagent system (MAS) is a type of AI system composed of multiple, independent (but interactive) agents, each capable of perceiving their environment and taking actions. Agents can be AI models, software programs, robots and other computational entities. Multiple agents can work toward a common goal that goes beyond the ability of individual agents, with increased adaptability and robustness.
